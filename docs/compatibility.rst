Compatibility
=============

A quick disclaimer on backwards-compatibility for Toyplot users:

Toyplot follows the `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ standard for
assigning version numbers in a way that has specific meaning.  As of this
writing Toyplot releases are still in the `0.y.z` development phase, which
means (among other things) that the API may change at any time.  We try not to
be abusive about it, and there have been a handful of breaking changes in
Toyplot's history, but you should be prepared for the occasional bump on the
road to the 1.0 release.
