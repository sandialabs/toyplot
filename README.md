Welcome to Toyplot, the kid-sized plotting toolkit for Python with grownup-sized goals:

* Develop beautiful interactive, animated plots that embrace the unique capabilities of electronic publishing and support repoducibility.
* Create the best possible data graphics “out-of-the-box”, maximizing data ink and minimizing chartjunk.
* Provide a clean, minimalist interface that scientists and engineers will love.
